# Interfaces

Interfaces are the way of inputting, editing and viewing data. The most easy way to understand interface is a datepicker. It allows you to represent the date in specified format & you can validate the inputs. It renders the date in better way by providing a diffrent UI than just a normal text.
In Database terms, interface reprents the column's value.

## üí°Interfaces allows you to:

-   Accept & View the data in diffrent formats i.e. Datepicker, Dropdown, Checkboxes.
-   Define the possible choices.
-   Do RegEx validation of data.
-   Define the database schema.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Default Options

Each interface inherits the below options(passed via `props` and imported via `mixin`)

| Option   | Type              | Default | Desc                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| type     | `String`          |         | Allowed fieldtypes this interface supports. List of all the fieldtypes can be found [here](https://docs.directus.io/guides/field-types.html) |
| length   | `[String,Number]` |         | Database length for the column.                                                                                                              |

## ‚ö° Enhancements

-   We can provide a prop named `savedValue` or similar which contains a value returned from an API, is immutable & changes only on successful crud. The `value` prop changes on user's interaction. Thus we can diffrentiate between server's state and user's state.
